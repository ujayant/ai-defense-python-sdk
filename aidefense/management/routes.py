"""Internal route helpers for the AI Defense Management API.

These helpers centralize relative API paths used by the management clients.
They are intentionally kept internal (module is prefixed with an underscore)
so that end users do not override or depend on these paths directly.

All paths returned here are relative. `BaseClient._get_url()` is responsible
for adding the base URL and API version.
